### INCREMENTAL FULL STACK PAIR PROGRAMMING ###

# Development Sequence for Messenger Clone

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

**Initial Project Setup**

   [x] Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore

   [x] Connect GitHub repository to Github

   [X] Set up NestJS backend project in /backend folder without any functionality and with Vitest testing

   [X] Test that the service is running

   [x] Deploy the server and retest

   [x] Set up Vitest for unit testing

**Setup Frontend**

   [x] Create Angular frontend project with Angular CLI

   [x] Configure Tailwind CSS

   [x] Test Tailwinds configuration by simplifying the app component and styling it with Tailwind.

**Connect frontend to backend**

   [x] Test connection between the frontend and the backend by getting the message "Hello World!" from the backend and display it in the middle of the frontend main app component and style it with Tailwind.

**Frontend Login Basic Structure**

   [x] Create the following folders for the frontend: components, pages and services

   [x] Create a home page component and a chat page component

   [x] Add routing to the two new pages

   [x] Move the display of message coming from the backend from app to home component

**Websocket basic implementation**

   [x] Implement websocket in the backend folder using its node_modules only

   [x] Create a simple .ts file to test it mimicking the client


   

   [ ] Build chat list component with virtual scrolling

   [ ] Create chat window component

   [ ] Implement message display with timestamps

   [ ] Add message input and sending functionality

## Phase 2: Core Messaging Features

**Backend API Development**

   [ ] Implement User APIs (GET /users, GET /users/:id)

   [ ] Implement Chat APIs with pagination:

   ```
   GET /chats/:id/messages?before=timestamp&limit=50
   ```

   [ ] Implement bulk operations:

   ```
   POST /chats/:id/messages/seen
   Body: { messageIds: string[] }
   ```

   [ ] Implement message sending/receiving via WebSocket

**Error Handling & Reliability**

   [ ] Implement retry mechanism with exponential backoff

   [ ] Add offline detection and recovery

   [ ] Implement offline message queuing

   [ ] Add error indicators in UI

## Phase 3: Testing & Performance 

**Testing Implementation**

   [ ] Optimize virtual scrolling performance

   [ ] Fine-tune IndexedDB caching strategy

   [ ] Set up API rate limiting

**Monitoring Setup**

   [ ] Integrate Winston for logging

   [ ] Set up Prometheus metrics

   [ ] Configure Grafana dashboards

   [ ] Implement health checks

## Phase 4: DevOps & Deployment

**Deployment Preparation**

   [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

   [ ] Configure production environment

   [ ] Set up MongoDB backup procedures

   [ ] Document deployment process

   [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
